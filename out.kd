## I. _The History_
{:#i}

While this work is intended as a discussion on the term "sociopathy" and its usage in our language today, one can hardly discuss sociopathy without first discussing psychopathy as the terms are "virtually synonymous"[^1] and the latter predates the former. The history of the two terms is heavily linked and so to fully distinguish them as terms that are used rather than simply noting the difference in their definitions, we must first explore the history of the terms themselves.

Attempting to start at the beginning has its problems as it may be difficult to determine the exact point at which people began to define the concept that was called "psychopathy" throughout the 20<sup>th</sup> century. Millon et al. state that the first comparable representation of psychopathy (more specifically they reference it as a close representation of antisocial personality disorder) was Theophrastus' (Θεόφραστος) concept of "The Unscrupulous Man,"[^2] sometimes also called "The Shameless Man":[^3]

This example, however, points to what turns out to be a constant issue with ideas of psychopathy (and later sociopathy) in that it frames crime as contextually ambivalent; here a person who commits crime that is legally (often not even morally or socially) considered wrong is a psychopath, regardless of their motivation. This may simply be a matter of brevity as providing such context and describing reasons that could justify a person's actions would lengthen the example tenfold. Nonetheless, there is a significant lack of such considerations especially among the older references to psychopathy.

It is at times uncertain in the literature regarding the history of psychopathy whether the author is discussing the presence of actual psychological disorder in the population or the presence of an understanding of that psychological disorder; perhaps this merely comes with the territory of analyzing history through literature. This is further muddled by the tendency to cite fictional villains as opposed to actual historical accounts of real humans suffering from a disorder.[^4][^5] These include such examples as Alex DeLarge from _A Clockwork Orange_, Hannibal Lecter from _Silence of the Lambs_,[^6] Norman Bates from _Psycho_, and Freddy Krueger from _A Nightmare on Elm Street_; characters ranging from empty husks designed to have the audience's ideas of fear projected onto them to those who exist solely to exemplify the issue with such naïve perceptions. To remedy this somewhat, we'll focus on ideas that led to the original coining of the terms until we reach the point at which said coining happened, then we'll cover how attempts to define the terms themselves evolved alongside psychology and sociology; we will also be using the assumption that whatever psychological disorders do exist have always existed in more or less the same fashion.

### I-1. Conception
{:#i-1}

Early approaches to understanding the mind and illnesses thereof were rooted in a dualistic idea of the material and immaterial (rather than the more modern materialistic approaches of anatomy and physiology) where the soul could both affect and be affected by the body. Herein originated ideas such as demonic possession as a source of illnesses, which would be pushed aside during the enlightenment as those modern concepts began taking root.[^7]

        Almqwist & Wiksell International, 1978), 17.

Prior to the 19<sup>th</sup> century, it was thoroughly believed that the mind and reason were one in the same, this concept came into question with [Philippe Pinel][25] who described certain cases he studied as "insanity without delirium" (_manie sans délire_).[^8] He described this idea further as retaining reason and understanding while being controlled by some unknown and powerful emotional force. [Benjamin Rush][26][^9] in 1812 and [James Cowles Prichard][28] in 1835 furthered this concept to more specifically pertain to morality, the latter credited with the formalization of "moral insanity." This imposition of moral positions on a previously morally neutral concept was eventually criticized by [Daniel Hack Tuke][29] in 1892, proposing the terminology be changed to "inhibitory insanity" to realign the concept to Pinel's original conception of an emotional affection that drives a person regardless of conscious reasoning.[^10]

       the Mind,_][27] (Philadelphia: Kimber & Richardson, 1812).

As an aside, before Prichard there was Carl Otto in 1825-1827 who had attempted to describe Pinel's idea of insanity without delirium from the perspective of phrenology, leading Millon et al. to describe his efforts in the following statement: "Applying phrenology, Otto gave a surprisingly modern description of the psychopathic mind."[^11] This should, if anything, be a massive red flag to the idea of psychopathy in general, given that phrenology is generally considered to be a completely useless field of pseudo science and will be discussed (along with physiognomy and craniography) in [Section III](#iii).

[Henry Maudsley][41], unlike Tuke, continued along the path carved out by Prichard rather than attempting to return to the intentions of Pinel, with ideas similar to those of Otto but deviating from the paradigm of phrenology. As such, he argued for a biological basis for "natural moral feelings."[^12] While Maudsley's belief at the time was that individuals and families suffering from degeneration (as per [Bénédict Morel][16]'s theory) would simply die off on their own eventually,[^13] over time he shifted towards a eugenicist view, believing that such illnesses needed to be purged manually. For the sake of brevity, we'll skip the works of [Cesare Lombroso][42],[^12] perhaps to be revisited at a later date for his contributions to criminology.[^14][^15][^16]

Toward the end of the 19<sup>th</sup> century and into the 20<sup>th</sup>, the idea of psychopathy took hold in Germany, where it took a less "value-laden" form as it had among the British. One such German, one who stands out in the historical context, was [Julius Ludwig August Koch][43] in 1891 who proposed that the previous standard of "moral insanity" be replaced with his new idea of "psychopathic inferiorities" (_Psychopathischen Minderwertigkeiten_).[^17][^18] He attributed this condition to "functional organic deviations" (_organische Abweichungen funktioneller Art_)[^19] that couldn't be rectified, a similar idea to the more modern idea of predisposition, though more assertive and derived once again from degeneration theory. Koch defined three degrees of severity of psychopathy:[^20][^18]

1. Disposition (_Disposition_), characterized by tension and high sensitivity,
2. Burden (_Belastung_), by egocentrism and impulsiveness, and
3. Degeneration (_Degeneration_), by borderline states.

      (Ravensburg: Maier, 1891).

[^18]: Millon et al., "Historical Conceptions...," 8.

[^19]: The exact language used by Koch is often ambiguous and confusing, a full
       discussion into this is outside the scope of this work, for such a
       discussion see:

       202-214.

[^20]: Gutmann, "J.L.A. Koch...," 208.

From these we can gather that this classification was meant as a very broad categorization, encompassing all personality disorders (not just antisocial).[^18] That analysis is reinforced by the introductory remarks of Koch's own work which state "[t]he term 'psychopathic inferiorities' comprises all abnormalities&mdash;either hereditary or acquired&mdash;which influence a human's personal life, but which do not constitute&mdash;even in their worst cases&mdash;mental illnesses."[^21] This meaning was adopted by Kurt Schneider as "abnormal personalities," in early conceptions of psychosis, which bears a similarly rough history to that of psychopathy.[^22]

### I-2. Eugenics
{:#i-2}

The nosology (classification of illnesses) developed by Koch included many forms of mental illness, providing loose distinctions between those that were "organic" and those caused by events in one's life. For psychopathy, such a distinction came to the forefront as [Adolf Meyer][30] proposed the concept of "constitutional inferiority" in 1904.[^18] This phrasing, however, lost favor as a descriptor as "inferior," despite its purely clinical intentions, gained a harsh derogatory connotation.

An alternative framing of psychopathy was provided by [Emil Kraepelin][31] in his work _Psychiatry: A Textbook_ (_Psychiatrie: Ein Lehrbuch_),[^9] in which he asserted the idea of "psychopathic personalities."[^23] This conception maintained the notion that personality disorders (psychopathy specifically here) originate from constitutional "defects" and therefore their symptoms are permanently a part of the affected person from birth, though Kraepelin focused much of his efforts on socio- and psychogenic forms of degeneracy. As a politically active psychiatrist, Kraepelin not only studied the causes of what he deemed to be issues in society (in his case the German _Volk_) but proposed solutions as well. These primarily took the form of education, prohibition, improving living conditions, helping the poor, and... "reasonable policies of racial hygiene" (_verständige Rassenhygiene_).[^24]

       Degeneration' by Emil Kraepelin (1908),][34]" _History of Psychiatry_ 18,
       3 (2007): 389-404.

In his aforementioned magnum opus, Kraepelin originally (1899) referred to "psychopathic states" which were, to him, a singular form of degeneration. Only afterwards in the 7<sup>th</sup> edition (1904) did he use the term "psychopathic personalities," which he had split into four categories at the time:[^25][^26]

[^25]: Millon et al., "Historical Conceptions...," 10.

[^26]: Marc-Antoine Crocq, "[Milestones in the history of personality
    disorders,][33]" _Dialogues in Clinical Neuroscience_ 15, 2 (June 2013):
    147-153.

1. morbid/pathological liars and swindlers (_die krankhaften Ttigner und
   Schwindler_), who were essentially conmen who were charming but immoral and
   unempathetic to others' needs, suffering themselves from unfaithful memory
   and instability of emotion;
2. criminals by impulse/pseudoquerulants (_die Pseudoquerulanten_), who
   committed theft, arson, and rape on impulse, corresponding somehow to the
   modern notion of paranoid personality;[^27]
3. professional/born criminals (_der Geborne Verbrecher_), who were disciplined
   and well mannered but ultimately manipulative (modeled after Lombroso and
   Prichard's conceptions);
4. and morbid vagabonds/irresolute/weak-willed (_die Haltlosen_) who simply
   stumbled through life, lacking in confidence and unable to take on
   responsibility or commit to anything.

[^27]: I'd attempted to match the analyses by Millon with those by Crocq, and by
       process of elimination drew a parallel between the former's "criminals by
       impulse" and the latter's "pseudoquerulants." This may not be perfect, as
       neither describes the members of this list in thorough enough detail, and
       I am as of yet incapable of tracking down a copy of the 7<sup>th</sup>
       edition of Kraepelin's work.

A cursory glance at this list may lead one to interpret it as more a list of types of criminals than any sort of nosology, and to an extent one would in that case be correct. As with many of the previous definitions, this iteration of the psychopathy diagnosis is blatantly driven by an attempt to classify criminality as a disease; this trend certainly does not stop here either. To further the absurdity of _this_ definition, Kraepelin went on to expand it in the 8<sup>th</sup> edition of his work into seven categories:[^25][^26]

1. the excitable (_die Erregbaren_);
2. the irresolute (_die Haltlosen_), carried over from the last edition;
3. those who are impulsive and follow their instincts (_Triebmenschen_),
   Kraepelin would have considered periodic drinkers and those who sought out
   pleasure to be among this category since he saw alcohol and syphilis as among
   the greatest threats to the people (_Volksgiften_)[^24][^26];
4. eccentrics (_Verschobenen_);
5. pathological liars and swindlers (_die krankhaften Ttigner und Schwindler_),
   also carried over from the last edition;
6. the antisocial/enemies of society (_Gesellschaftsfeinde_);
7. and the quarrelsome (_die Streitsüchtige_).

The final three are described by Millon et al. to have "features similar to the current notions of the antisocial,"[^25] with the sixth category being the most similar.

Now, Kraepelin probably wasn't a "Nazi."[^28] By some definitions, one must have been a member of the Nationalist Socialist Party in order to have actually been a Nazi, and Kraepelin died in 1926 leaving behind no record of ever joining said party. Of course, that didn't stop him from supporting eugenics,[^29] or ethnic cleansing,[^24] or declaring people to be mentally ill by their political positions, or being an anti-Semite[^30], but I digress.[^31]

[^28]: Though two of the doctors he mentored, [Paul Nitsche][36] and [Ernst
       Rüdin][37], were very much so. In fact, the former was executed with a
       fucking guillotine for being a Nazi.

[^31]: There's a book's worth of details on how fucked up Kraepelin was, but
       like Lombroso it would detract too much from the primary narrative here.
       For instance, he was fired from his work as a psychiatrist for neglecting
       his clinical duties; elsewhere he wrote that the reason he did not like
       doing such work was that he saw it as a waste to expend effort caring for
       those he saw as inferior while others in the world that he saw as decent
       people were suffering.

Attempts were made to separate the clinical notion of psychopathy from the value judgements imposed on it by the likes of Koch and Kraepelin, primarily by [Kurt Schneider][39] in post-World War I Germany (_[Weimarer Republik][40]_).[^32] This was partially due to the observation that the personality traits that may lead someone to criminality don't necessarily do so, and many who would have "psychopathic personalities" weren't necessarily doomed to a life of crime; not only were the people theorized by this analysis not all criminals living at odds with society, many were quite successful in positions of political and social power, according to Schneider's observations.[^33] To that end, he attempted to use clinical/psychological terms, rather than the previously common social and criminal terminology, defining ten categories of "abnormal personalities":[^26]

[^32]: Richard F. Wetzell, _Inventing the Criminal: A History of German
       Criminology, 1880-1945,_ (Chapel Hill: The University of North Carolina
       Press, 2000), 246.

[^33]: Millon et al., "Historical Conceptions...," 12.

1. hyperthymic (_Hyperthymische_),
2. depressive,
3. insecure (_Selbstunsichere_),
4. fanatical (_Fanatische_),
5. recognition-seeking (_Geltungsbedürftige_),
6. with labile mood (_Stimmungslabile_),
7. explosive (_Explosible_),
8. emotionally-blunted (_Gemütlose_),
9. weakwilled (_Willenlose_),
10. asthenics (_Asthenische_).

Schneider also held a then novel position on the distinction between normal and abnormal personality types, being that clinically abnormal personality traits would be meaningless to describe as extreme forms of normal ones.[^26] This sort of definition, however, is problematic in that it draws a simple dichotomy between "normal" and everything else, the latter group of which can come in an infinite number of forms. Thus the previously given categories were merely a subset defined to give focus to those abnormalities that caused suffering on either the individual or society, the "psychopathic personalities."[^34] As this line is clearly arbitrarily drawn based on whether one considers specific traits to case suffering in society, Schneider suggested work be done to study the whole category of "abnormal personalities," but the very act of drawing said line served to keep focus on the "psychopathic" group within it.[^35]

[^34]: Wetzell, _Inventing the Criminal_, 247.

[^35]: Wetzell, _Inventing the Criminal_, 249.

On the question of constitutionality of these personalities, Schneider fell in line with many of the developments that preceded him. While he agreed that environment has an effect on personality, he maintained that abnormalities in a personality were congenital and typically hereditary.[^34] However, he did oppose eugenics and even fought against the influence of the Nazis in psychiatry (at least so far as defending his own department from them).[^36]

Unsurprisingly, despite Schneider's lackluster attempt to push against the trend, the concept of psychopathy eventually found its home not in psychiatry, not in therapy,[^37] not in the hearts of those who sought to help inflicted individuals better themselves, but in criminology. Specifically the section of criminology that tackles "the problem of explaining crime and criminal behavior, which is the problem of scientifically accounting for the presence of crime and criminals in society."[^38] Of course, in a society that had in the not so distant past claimed laws to be backed by divine right, one could see how the breaching of law would be seen to some extent as an absurd act against human nature. If laws are inherent to human society, or to the universe even, then it would be against the nature of humans to break laws, and therefore deviant.[^39]

[^37]: Supposedly this was not intentional, but a result of psychopathy being
       considered untreatable; however, given what we now know about the
       broadness of this concept and the possibilities of treating personality
       disorders, it is more likely that it was merely considered untreatable to
       avoid investing resources in caring for difficult individuals.

While agreeing with many of the conclusions and observations brought forth by Kurt Schneider, [Karl Birnbaum][38] returned to previous approaches to the idea of psychopathy by focusing on the connection between it and criminality. Birnbaum believed that there was such a link, regardless of how little statistical backing there was at the time, and thus aimed to explain said link; he did so by defining three deficiencies in psychopaths:[^40]

[^40]: Wetzell, _Inventing the Criminal_, 252.

1. reactions disproportionate to stimuli,
2. traits not harmonized,
3. and lack of psychological resilience and balance.

Between these, an afflicted person would be incapable of adapting to life, often turning to crime as a result but not in all cases. He also claimed that there were certain traits (among those defined by Schneider) that lent themselves to antisocial behavior while others directly lead to outright criminal behavior. There were also those that did not lend themselves to criminality, but could, by situational influences, be pushed to commit crime. Along with all this, he claimed that each abnormality was associated with a particular brand of crime as well. These tenuous sorts of connections were, according to him, the reason why not all psychopaths were criminals, but were merely at higher risk of becoming as such.[^40]

![Portrait of Karl Birnbaum][69]

{: .pullquote .pullquote_image .pullquote_left}

Birnbaum had also in decades prior introduced the term "sociopathic" as a more apt description of the condition theorized in Kraepelin's work. Though it was not at all popular at the time, circa 1909, he derived the term from the idea that antisocial behavior was only rarely directly caused by a constitutional condition and was more commonly a result of social conditioning.[^41][^42]

The Danish psychiatrist August Wimmer was, like Kraepelin and those after him, critical of degeneration theory as an explanation of presumed hereditary criminality, and, like Kraepelin, was also concerned with "racial improvement." The alternative he supported was that of Mendelian inheritance, more similar to modern genetics; to that end he supported marital restrictions, sterilization, and forced abortion to avoid the "hereditary taint" of these characteristics. Of note, Wimmer included in his classification of psychopaths (1929) more specific types such as the "sexually perverted" and "asocial."[^43]

[^43]: Millon et al., "Historical Conceptions...," 13.

Immediately after Wimmer, though more relevant to discussion of Birnbaum, came [George E. Partridge][45]'s review "Current Conceptions of Psychopathic Personality" in the July of 1930, wherein he notes that the antisocial behaviors of "psychopaths" were likely a focal point among psychiatrists merely due to their evident nature,[^44] and that this focus has also lead to disagreement as to the actual rate at which psychopathy occurs.[^45]

<!-- Talk about Freud here? let's not. -->

This critique of the field at the time came despite a recently occurring push to once again create a coherent definition of psychopathy, this time using the new methodology of psychoanalysis as pioneered by [Sigmund Freud][46]. In 1925, [August Aichhorn][47] wrote that delinquency was akin to a disease and so the criminal behaviors associated with it were merely symptoms rather than the whole of the problem. He theorized that either too permissive or too authoritarian parenting would create a foundation upon which such a "disease" would form later on in life.[^46]

[^46]: Millon et al., "Historical Conceptions...," 15.

In the same year, this concept was further solidified under psychoanalysis by [Karl Abraham][48] and [Wilhelm Reich][49]. Abraham asserted that antisocial behaviors stemmed from "psychological undernourishment" as a child, thus affecting the _libido_ such that a hatred forms to be later directed at the whole of society. This was extended by Reich who claimed that the behaviors are then a result of the _superego_ being incapable of retaining control of the _ego_.[^46] Together, Freud, Abraham, and Reich formed a character typology that would influence our modern ideas of personality disorders.[^26] Partridge also joined into the psychoanalysis in 1927, concluding that the delinquent behavior perceived among supposed psychopaths originated from "unfulfilled oral needs."[^46]

### I-3. Operationalization
{:#i-3}

While the works of [Eugen Kahn][50], one of Kraepelin's assistants[^47] who did not go on to serve the Nazis, are often overlooked in the history, the analysis he gave in 1931 (as quoted by [David Kennedy Henderson][51]) are rather indicative of the language used in the '30s. According to Hendersom, Kahn first gave a simple classification in four groups:[^48]

2. constitutional inferiority ("habitual inadequate behavior"),
3. idiosyncratic personality,
4. and "psychotoid."

His analytical inventory is then given as three groups with several subgroups as "quantitative deviations":[^49]

[^49]: Henderson, _Psychopathic States_, 22.

1. impulsive, similar to the _Triebmenschen_ group defined by Kraepelin and
   specifically including "sex variants" such as masturbation, homosexuality,
   sadism, masochism, exhibitionism, fetishism, and pedophilia (keep this mildly
   infuriating list in mind as it comes up several times going forward);
2. disturbances of temperament:
   1. _hyperthymic_, similar to Schneider's hyperthymic and explosive, including
      being vivacious and cheerful;
   2. _hypothymic_, "phlegmatic" and affectless;
   3. and _dysphoric_, which Henderson claimed to possibly be close to
      _cyclothemic_, being anxious and gloomy.
3. _ego_ and character manifestations:
   1. "active autists"[^50] and the egocentric,
   2. "passive autists" and the "ego-searcher,"
   3. and "ambitendent."

[^50]: The term "autist" itself deserves a significant further discussion,
       perhaps this will spark a long series of articles on "Issues in Language
       and Psychiatry" or something along those lines.

It is noted that this system is so broad and vague that it is clinically useless, a problem Kahn attempted to fix with a more robust list of instances that isn't meaningfully distinguishable from Schneider's list.[^51]

Henderson himself proposed a categorization of psychopathic personalities into three non-exclusive groups in his 1939 work:[^53]

[^51]: Henderson, _Psychopathic States_, 23.

[^53]: Henderson, _Psychopathic States_, 38.

1. Predominantly aggressive.
2. Predominantly passive or inadequate.
3. Predominantly creative.

This is another development in the movement against viewing psychopathy and criminality as synonymous, though caused plenty of controversy due to overlap with the passive/inadequate type and other diagnoses (specifically neuroticism), as well as people simply disagreeing that the creative type could even be considered a psychopath.[^54]

[Benjamin Karpman][53], in 1941, maintained the distinction of psychopathy into two categories (similar to beliefs held by Birnbaum): "idiopathic" and "symptomatic." Here "idiopathic" referred to the constitutional sort, where there was a guiltless, antisocial sort of personality with not discernable psychogenic history; "symptomatic" were a group that wasn't composed of "true psychopaths" but rather of "neurotics 'parading' as psychopaths," where the antisocial behavior was the result of internal conflict rather than originating from a constitutional condition.[^55] These two groups have also been referred to as "primary" and "secondary" psychopaths respectively.[^56]

1941 also saw the publication of [Hervey M. Cleckley][58]'s _The Mask of Sanity: An Attempt to Reinterpret Some Issues About the So-Called Psychopathic Personality_,[^57] which was his attempt to "reinterpret" some issues he saw with people's ideas of the "psychopathic personality." Because of the influence of this book, Cleckley is often described as the pioneer of the modern (primarily mid to late 20<sup>th</sup> century) conception of psychopathy[^4][^58][^59] providing the "best definition of psychopathy"[^60] and was even in his own time considered and important contributor.[^61] Like Schneider and Birnbaum, Cleckley did not believe that psychopaths were universally criminal and could often be found filling roles of great importance and power;[^62] he further aligned with Schneider in his attempts to create a clinical definition of psychopathy, one that could be used separate from theories of its origin.[^63]

Rather than categorization of various sorts of psychopaths, the focus of Cleckley's work was on the creation of a set of criteria by which a psychopath could be diagnosed.[^63] It is because of his work on such a definition and its similarity to how we define mental illnesses today that Cleckley is regarded so highly (as stated earlier). There were 16 criteria in his definition,[^64] the first nine of which were "key features" and the latter seven were "other":[^65]

[^64]: Hervey M. Cleckley, _The Mask of Sanity_ 5<sup>th</sup> edition (1988),
       338.

[^65]: This is the language used by Hildebrand, who cites Andrews and Bonta's
       _The psychology of criminal conduct_ 3<sup>rd</sup> ed. as its origin.
       This list has also been rearranged to match the order used by Hildebrand
       (on page 6) for the purposes of this categorization.

1. Unresponsive in general interpersonal relations
2. Superficial charm and good "intelligence"[^66]
3. Absence of delusions and other signs of irrational thinking
4. Absence of "nervousness" or other neurotic manifestations
5. Lack of remorse or shame
6. Poor judgment and failure to learn from experience
7. Pathological egocentricity and incapacity for love
8. General poverty in major affective reactions
9. Inadequately motivated antisocial behavior
10. Impersonal, trivial, and poorly integrated sex life
11. Unreliability
12. Failure to follow any life plan
13. Untruthfulness and insincerity
14. Suicide rarely carried out
15. Specific loss of insight
16. Fantastic and uninviting behavior with drink and sometimes without

[^66]: The quotation marks around "intelligence" are present in Cleckley's _Mask
       of Sanity_ 5<sup>th</sup> ed. but not in Hildebrand's retelling of it.

One may readily notice that many of those items categorized as "other features" are nearly universally applicable depending on interpretation. Ideas like unreliability and loss of insight point to the retention of the biases found in many of the earlier attempts at definitions; they (even when accounting for the further discussion offered in Cleckley's work[^67][^68]) fail to describe anything significantly deviant from the norm but rather describe arbitrarily more extreme forms of biases or issues any given person is likely to experience. Unreliability can be seen as simply a lack of motivation, something that is heavily dependent on the specific situation, and while Cleckley attempts to distinguish this as a form of unreliability that neglects even the strongest social obligation[^67] it remains true that there is virtually no means by which to guarantee without a doubt someone remains motivated to any cause. The latter example, specific loss of insight, is also described in a way that may bear some distinction from the norm, but only so long as one does not understand that there is no universal or objective perspective and so one's inability to see from the perspective of those around them is not necessarily so deviant as to be considered a disorder. Of course, these are merely two examples out of the list of 16, but the same general critique applies to nearly all the others; though such a harsh analysis could be easily applied to any clinical definition, the point here remains that these were not derived in a vacuum, but rather off the back of the aforementioned works of Kahn,[^69] which were in turn derived from those of Schneider and Kraepelin, and so the flimsiness of the definitions is not so certainly merely due to the requirements of such definitions to be so.

It is important to realize at this point that the efforts from hereon in the 20<sup>th</sup> century were not to reevaluate the concept of psychopathy from a new clinical and scientific perspective but to reestablish already existing ideas as both clinical and scientific. The distinction here is that rather than purging all previous notions and exploring the fundamentals of a perceived problem through scientific means, what was done was at best a meta-study of said previous notions that was then translated into a format commonly used in clinical contexts. That is to say that rather than exploring the origin of what would be seen as psychopathy in a patient, these new definitions would continue to represent an arbitrary set of "antisocial" behaviors labeled as symptoms.

However, Cleckley did make some attempt to explicitly separate psychopathy from criminality, drawing distinction in the fact that criminals often commit crime for a specific end (such as the accumulation of wealth) whereas psychopaths do so for the satisfaction of committing the crime in itself.[^70] This is a clear improvement over some of the earliest ideas of psychopathy, but there remains the emphasis on finding a correlation (without any statistical or often even theoretical basis) between personality disorders and criminality. He maintains this distinction while also admitting that the term is necessarily vague and is most often used without such clarity.[^71]

Plenty of the aforementioned figures had mentioned some category of "sexual deviants," though they had merely included such a category in a wider context of what is effectively the classification of various criminal behaviors. Starting in the '40s, there was a more significant focus on what they then called "sexual psychopaths." We then return to Karpman, who published a significant number of works on this concept, including one later in 1951 explicitly titled "The Sexual Psychopath."[^72] Leading up to this, Karpman was the Chief Psychotherapist of the St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington, D.C., where he "treated" people for non-conforming sexual and gender identities.[^73] While there, he worked to find what was then called "latent homosexuality" in criminals, which he believed to be the core cause of their criminality.[^74] This often took thorough analysis of every aspect of a person's life before finally finding something indicative of such an idea,[^75] likely due to its incoherence as a concept. This development is left out of most of the popular histories of psychopathy (such as Millon et al.), mostly due to the focus of said histories being on ideas and concepts that remained a part of psychopathy and not on tangents that exemplify the problems with historical and modern definitions of it such as the narrative being presented in this work.

       the Queer Criminal_, had Karpman going so far as to state that
       professional fighting was indicative of "latent homosexuality" as it
       included a man pounding other men.

Returning to "The Sexual Psychopath," Karpman explicitly states that "[t]he terms 'sexual psychopath' and 'sexual psychopathy' have no legitimate place in psychiatric nosology or dynamic classification."[^76] This comes after a lengthy introduction in which he describes the lack of reasonable certainty in the definition of sexual crime by both the public and the law, and that the concept of sexual psychopathy would be reliant on such definitions.[^77]

### I-4.1 Standardization 1: The _DSM_ and _DSM-II_
{:#i-41}

The late 20<sup>th</sup> century saw a more distinct split in concepts of psychopathy/sociopathy than past eras, in the interest of properly describing both camps we'll cover both trends simultaneously. This is not completely unique from the previous sections as there were often tangents, deviations, and splits; however, the splits present here have propagated to our modern conceptions, adding in a greater necessity to track them.

As a continuation of its pre-World War II mission of aiding the US Bureau of the Census in gathering data on the frequency of mental illnesses (and by necessity producing definitions of illnesses to be used in gathering said statistics), the [American Psychiatric Association (APA)][118] Committee on Nomenclature and Statistics developed the first edition of its [_Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)_][119] in 1952.[^78] This initial _DSM_ was effectively the APA's version of the sixth edition of the [World Health Organization (WHO)][120]'s [_International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD)_][121], developed shortly beforehand and itself influenced by the Veterans Administration's classifications to aid in the treatment of servicemen and veterans of World War II.[^78] The definition of "personality disorder" used in the Manual at the time listed four subtypes:[^79]

        20, 2018.

[^79]: Hildebrand, _Psychopathy..._, 9.

1. Personality pattern disturbances.
2. Personality trait disturbances.
3. Sociopathic personality disturbances.
4. Special symptom reactions.

The third entry here being of particular interest to this work, the definition of which included several categories of "reactions": antisocial reaction, dyssocial reaction, sexual deviation, and addiction (alcoholism and drug addiction).[^80] Once again we see here the inclusion of "sexual deviance," further described as:[^81]

[^80]: The Committee on Nomenclature and Statistics of the American
        Psychiatric Association, _Diagnostic and Statistical Manual: Mental
        Disorders_ (Massachusetts: American Psychiatric Association Mental
        Hospital Service, 1952), 38.

[^81]: APA, _DSM_, 39.

> "_[Sexual deviation] is reserved for deviant sexuality which is not  symptomatic of more extensive syndromes, such as schizophrenic and obsessional reactions. The term includes most of the cases formerly classed as "psychopathic personality with pathologic sexuality." The diagnosis will specify the type of the pathologic behavior, such as homosexuality, transvestism, pedophilia, fetishism and sexual sadism (including rape, sexual assault, mutilation)._"

The _DSM_'s definitions often included the term "reaction" which was indicative of the influence of Adolf Meyer (from Section I-2.)'s conception of mental illness as the way in which a personality reacts to psychological, social, and biological factors.[^78]

In 1957, [Timothy Leary][85] published _Interpersonal Diagnosis of Personality: A Functional Theory and Methodology for Personality Evaluation_, in which he described a category of personality disorders that are motivated by a social adjustment through rebellion, a desire to retain uniqueness and individuality during periods of otherwise social development.[^82] Leary was at one point labeled the "most dangerous man in America" by [Richard Nixon][90],[^83] due to his influence in the use of psychedelics, including the [Concord Prison Experiment][87] which tested the effects of [psilocybin][88]-assisted psychotherapy on recidivism rates.[^84]

[Hans Eysenck][91]'s work throughout the '50s similarly challenged the traditional models of psychopathy and personality while not completely disposing of the concept of a constitutional disposition.[^82] **Need to actually talk about Eysenck's concepts of personality.**

Similar to Leary,[^85] Eysenck was very controversial in his time (and still is to this day).[^86] The divergence of the two is evident in that the phrase "fights with the establishment" is used for the latter to refer to his rejection of Freudian psychoanalysis,[^87] criticism of psychotherapy,[^88] claims that the link between tobacco and cancer was based on personality rather than carcinogens,[^87] and support of eugenicist models of intelligence.[^89]

The empirical research done by [Lee N. Robins][122] in 1966, published under the title _Deviant Children Grown Up: A Sociological and Psychiatric Study of Sociopathic Personality_, indicated that antisocial behavior in childhood was a greater predictor of alcoholism, incarceration, or other problems in adulthood than childhood fears or depression.[^92] This publication was, in the words of Felton James Earls, "a major contributor to lifting psychiatry out of its deep morass of diagnostic and therapeutic abstractions into the realm of scientific rationale and empirical methods."[^93] As per its relevance to the study and operationalization of psychopathy and its adjacent concepts, _Deviant Children_ affirmed the view of antisocial behavior as a personality disorder[^93] and in doing so showed the limitations of the diagnostic criteria given by the _DSM-I_,[^94] later going on to heavily influence the criteria in the _DSM-II_[^95] with her removal of "criteria that could not be operationalized for research purposes."[^96]

The revisions made between the _DSM-I_ and the _DSM-II_ in 1968 were relatively insignificant. To combat the lack of acceptance seen by the _ICD_(-6 and -7)'s the WHO had commissioned a committee (headed by [Erwin Stengel][126]) to review issues with the diagnostic criteria in the _ICD_; while this review was highly influential in its own right, neither the _ICD-8_ nor the _DSM-II_ took any major direction from it.[^78] The language of "reaction" and the idea of reactivity that was present in the _DSM-I_ was removed in the _DSM-II_, removing the implications of Meyer's psychobiological models from the criteria.[^79] Personality disorders were, however, significantly renovated in the update, including the creation of "antisocial personality" as a category of personality disorder that subsumed the antisocial and dyssocial reactions,[^79] an alteration that while superficially rewriting the intent of the classifications retained the influence that Cleckley's works on psychopathy had on nosology in psychiatry at the time.[^97] The redefinition of reactions that were listed in the _DSM-I_ as different manifestations of one of the then four categories of personality disorders contributed to the jump from four to ten (plus two additional "unspecified" types) types of personality disorder:[^98]

Additionally, sexual deviations that were previously included under "sociopathic personality disturbances" were put into the separate section "302 Sexual Deviations," giving the listed types of disturbances as homosexuality, fetishism, pedophilia, transvestism, exhibitionism, voyeurism, sadism, masochism, and other and unspecified sexual deviation.[^99] Addiction was similarly separated from personality disorders and put into sections 303 and 304, for alcoholism and drug dependence respectively;[^100] the latter group was also then given diagnoses for specific substances or substance types, opium, cocaine, cannabis, and barbiturates being a few of those included.[^101]

Despite these changes and the general removal of "sociopathic personality disturbances," psychiatrists at the time continued using the diagnoses of "sociopath" and "sociopathic personality," showing both a loose interpretation of the _DSM_'s categories and a resistance to change.[^97] This trend came under heavy scrutiny of [Richard L. Jenkins][138], a key contributor to the _DSM-II_ and later an uncredited consultant to the _DSM-III_ for personality disorders.[^102]

Georg K. Stürup described work in attempting to treat personality disorders in his 1968 work _Treating the 'Untreatable': Chronic Criminals at Herstedvester_; this was for the most part an effort to get those at the Herstedvester Detention Center to improve through voluntary treatment.[^103] He proposed that a belief in improvement held by the detainee would increase the success rate of the treatment. Notably, some treatments included psychopharmacological elements, such as castration for those who had committed sexual crimes.[^103]

[Theodore Millon][130], inspired by [Carl Gustav Hempel][131]'s "Aspects of Scientific Explanation" (1965), believed in "empirical or inductive models that identify and describe associations among observed variables via statistical analyses;"[^104] in short, Millon supported a wholly empirical approach to defining the dimensions of personality. To that end, he published his work _Modern Psychopathology_ in 1969, in which he argued for his approach to psychopathology that required theory, empirical observations, and the intent of clinical practice all within the general lens of open-mindedness towards new ideas within the field[^104].

While not particularly influential, Ben Bursten sought to define the essence of "[t]he diagnosis of sociopathy, together with its predecessors&mdash;psychopathy, psychopathic personality, constitutional psychopathic inferiority, etc.&mdash;" by the means of his psychoanalytical perspective. From this he concluded with what he called the "manipulative personality," defined by a fragile form of narcissism that required actions to bolster self-esteem[^105]. Due to this definition being concerned with the source or motive of the person, a person would not be required to have "committed offenses against society" in order to be determined to fit its description[^105]; this being perhaps an implementation of Bursten's opposition to the value judgements of other characterizations of sociopathy/psychopathy.[^106]

### I-4.2 Standardization 2: The _DSM-III_
{:#i-42}

Through the 1940s Freudian psychoanalysis dominated the field of psychiatry, and with it a largely negative view on psychiatric diagnoses. This perspective was validated by Philip Ash (1949)[^107] and Beck et al. (1962)[^108] whose works showed a relative lack of consistency from psychiatrist to psychiatrist diagnosing a single patient.[^109] The alternative interpretation of this dilemma was, of course, that diagnostic criteria needed to be more consistent and less vague.

The Department of Psychiatry at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, Missouri stood against this Freudian wave, with the head of the department, Dr. Edwin Gildea, leaning more towards biological theories for psychiatric illnesses[^110] and supporting empirical research in the field.[^111] In 1949, [Eli Robins][142] joined the department after studying systemic clinical investigation under Dr. Mandel Cohen at Harvard;[^112] as part of this "systemic" methodology, Robins believed in replicability as a necessity for clinical validity.[^111] In the following year, 1950, [George Winokur][140] also joined the department, having likely escaped Freudian influence by maintaining a "strong Meyerian tradition."[^111] [Samuel Guze][141] attended Washington University in both undergraduate and medical school, beginning his psychiatric training there in 1950 and becoming a faculty member in 1955.[^111] These three concerned themselves over the state of psychiatric diagnoses constantly, coming under critique by psychoanalysts as being "too mechanistic" but nonetheless pushing forward to promote research and literary review for the sake of improving the state of said diagnoses.[^111]

To the point of literary studies, the group had created a list of works required of every new faculty member to read regarding psychiatric diagnostics; upon his undertaking of the reading, John Feighner, who began his residency at Washington University in 1966, proposed members of the department publish a paper reviewing the works in the list and providing an outline of the concepts therein.[^113] A committee was formed with Robins, Winokur, Guze, and Feighner, along with the addition of Robert Woodruff (brought in for his expertise on the concepts at hand) and Rodrigo Muñoz (who had joined the department in 1965 and was already planning work with Robins beforehand).[^113]

The meetings of this committee soon came to the realization that there was a great amount of inconsistency and vagueness in the literature, leading to difficulty with drawing any conclusions from it.[^114] Upon this realization, the group shifted towards a new goal of improving the state of things, leading to nine months of semi-regular meetings to successively review and outline new criteria for 14 psychiatric disorders[^113] in what would be informally referred to as the "Feighner Criteria".[^97] Over the course of these meetings, other residents and faculty from the University would be called in to consult on various diagnoses, including Richard Hudgens, George Murphy, and, most notably, Lee Robins.[^113]

The criteria laid out by the committee for antisocial personality disorder (being the equivalent of sociopathy in this categorization) was based on the criteria developed by Lee Robins' 1966 work, just as with the _DSM-II_, but with significant revisions made.[^115] The coauthors of the Feighner Criteria aimed to avoid intersects between antisocial personality and poverty and drug abuse, removing the criteria of excessive drugs, heavy drinking, and public financial care from Robins' original list; they also removed criteria for lacking in the desired diagnostic specificity, those being lack of friends, impulsive behavior, suicide attempts, and "many somatic symptoms;" finally, based on the studies of Guze along with Donald Goodwin, a new criterion of running away from home was added.[^115]

In the end, the criteria were published as "Diagnostic Criteria for Use in Psychiatric Research" in the Archives of General Psychiatry in 1972.[^116]

That same year, the Clinical Research Branch of the National Institute for Mental Health (NIMH) began sponsoring a collaborative project on the psychobiology of depression, with [Robert L. Spitzer][143] and [Jean Endicott][154] developing a diagnostic criteria.[^117] Following the recommendation of Dr. Martin Kratz, the two sought to collaborate with Eli Robins and his colleagues at Washington University,[^117] basing this new criteria, dubbed the Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC), on the Feighner Criteria they had developed.[^118][^119]

        Criteria][156]," _Archives of General Psychiatry_ 35 (Jun. 1978), 773.

The basic concept of antisocial personality according to Spitzer et al. was described in the subsection for "Depressive Disorders Not Meeting the Full Criteria for Major Depressive Disorder" in the "Rationale for the Specific Diagnostic Concepts Included in the RDC," a category for disorders that show depressive symptoms but don't meet the full definition of Major Depressive Disorder:[^120]

[^120]: Spitzer, et al., "RDC," 778.

> _"This category is for subjects with a chronic or recurrent disorder characterized by antisocial behavior in many areas, beginning before the age of 15 and typically from earliest school years or before and persisting into adulthood. As an adult there is invariably a markedly impaired capacity to sustain lasting, close, warm, and responsible relationships with family, friends, or sexual partners, and a failure to sustain good job performance over a period of several years."_

In 1974, [Lorna Smith Benjamin][158] published her "Structural Analysis of Social Behavior," stemming from the assumption of scientific psychology stating that behavior is "orderly and lawful" and developing a model that would in theory allow for predictions of future behaviors based on present or past behavior.[^121] This analysis continued in the tradition of Leary in defining a limited set of dimensions such that the whole space of behaviors would fit in "real space," that is limiting the definitions to two or three dimensions as opposed to a "multidimensional" approach that would eschew such limitations in an effort to achieve the most accurate mathematical model possible.[^121]

[^121]: Lorna Smith Benjamin, "[Structural Analysis of Social Behavior][157],"
        _Psychological Review_ 81, 5 (1974), 392.

Benjamin's model synthesized and expanded on Leary's model and that of Earl S. Schaefer (1965),[^122] who had created a version of the interpersonal circle specifically for describing parental behavior.[^123] Early versions of Schaefer's model used two dimensions: control-authority and love-hate; later a third dimension of lax-firm was added.[^122] John L. Rinn's "Structure of Phenomenal Domains" (1965)[^124] also lends some concepts to Benjamin's concepts, expanding on Leary to include not only interpersonal behavior but intrapsychic, pairing the displayed behaviors with associated feelings.[^122] In total, the combination of these models created three diamond-shaped surfaces, named "parentlike," "childlike," and "introject."[^125]

        Inventory," _Child Development_ 36, 2 (Jun. 1965): 413-424.

        72, 6 (1965): 445-466.

[^125]: Benjamin, "Structural Analysis...," 395.

Combining the ideas of Leary, Schaefer, and Rinn required some amount of reconciliation due to a variety of intersect and differences; for example, Leary dichotomized dominate and submit, whereas Schaefer dichotomized control and autonomy. While similar, the implications of these dichotomies are not necessarily equal, a problem that Benjamin solved by placing submit as the complement of dominate and emancipate (autonomy) as its opposite.[^125] This complementary behavior concept was discussed earlier by Robert C. Carson in his 1969 book _Interaction Concepts of Personality_, describing the interaction as one person offering a given behavior and thus inviting its complement.[^125] In a parent-child relationship this can be interpreted as, though not necessarily in a fixed manner, the reason that hatred in the parent will cause hatred in the child, a logic that in conjunction with the work of Schaefer gives the first two surfaces (parentlike and childlike) their names.[^126]

[^126]: Benjamin, "Structural Analysis...," 396.

Antisocial personality was, within this framework, described as detached form of a desire to control others; the criminal level of antisociality that the _DSM_ dictates are then described as "inordinate autonomy taking, addiction to control, and lack of attachment to others."[^127] This would also then apply to people of high socioeconomic status who abuse their power but aren't necessarily diagnosable by the _DSM_'s standards.[^127] Like Leary before her, Benjamin's work amounts to an alternative to the orthodoxy of the _DSM_, but did not in its time detract in any significant way from the development of the _DSM-III_ as a list of taxonomic rather than dimensional descriptors.

[^127]: Millon et al., "Historical Conceptions...," 25.

1974 also saw the appointment of Spitzer as the chair of the APA's nosological task force, making him a central figure in the definitions used in the _DSM-III_.[^128]

[^128]: Pickersgill, "Standardising antisocial...," 544.

The _DSM-III_ continued the influence of Lee Robins from the _DSM-II_ and in a much less superficial manner, moving towards the social deviance model for diagnoses rather than the trait model of previous criteria.[^95] However, the definitions maintained the problems of many previous conceptions in that they focused on the classification of criminality over clinical treatment; though items associated with psychopathy's outward presentation (such as 'coldness') were included as criteria for narcissistic personality disorder (NPD).[^95]

Millon also served in the Personality Disorder Advisory Group during the development of the _DSM-III_,[^104] with his category of "active-independent personality" working as a starting point for what then became "antisocial personality disorder" (ASPD)[^129] alongside the RDC and the work of Robins as mentioned earlier.[^130] The use of Robins' research (and the RDC) kept in line with the trend towards empirically validated criteria from the '60s on; however, even Robins' own criteria were subject to further scrutiny, with the criterion of "lack of guilt" being excluded from ASPD for being "too difficult to evaluate reliably."[^130] Of course, none of the influences on the _DSM-III_'s criteria came uncontested, with members of the committee such as [John R. Lion][146] pushing to base the definition more on Cleckley's psychopathy than on Robins' sociopathy,[^130] prioritizing psychology over behavior, etiology over symptomology. In general, however, Spitzer et al. were more sympathetic to the ideas of Kraepelin, holding symptomology over etiology.[^97]

[^129]: Millon et al., "Historical Conceptions...," 23.

[^130]: Pickersgill, "Standardising antisocial...," 548.

Lion's continued efforts to bring psychopathy into the _DSM_ were in part informed by his clinical experience with "aggressive individuals" that couldn't be defined as having "antisocial personality" as it was defined by an unstable form of aggression, whereas "psychopathic personality" was characterized as an unwillingness/inability to conform to social laws and an "impoverished sense of ethical and moral values."[^131] This attempt was refuted on the grounds that the definitions he was using were too difficult to operationalize, going against the intentions of the committee. Some effort was made to compromise and effectively include both sociopathy and psychopathy within the definition of ASPD based on a suggestion from Jenkins to create two subtypes: "socialized" and "undersocialized;" though after some consideration Spitzer ultimately decided against the idea.[^102]

In the end, the _DSM-III_, published in 1980, defined "301.70 Antisocial Personality Disorder" as:[^132]

[^132]:  American Psychiatric Association, _Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
        Mental Disorders_ Third Edition (1980), 317-318.

> "_[A] Personality Disorder in which there are a history of continuous and chronic antisocial behavior in which the rights of others are violated, persistence into adult life of a pattern of antisocial behavior began before the age of 15, and a failure to sustain good job performance over a period of several years._"

As with all other personality disorders in section 301, the _DSM-III_ also described associated features, impairment, complications, predisposing factors, age of onset, sex ratio, prevalence, familial pattern, differential diagnosis, and diagnostic criteria for Antisocial Personality Disorder. In this lattermost section, five main criteria are listed, two of which contain a set of various other criteria (here abbreviated):[^133]

[^133]:  APA, _DSM-III_, 320-321.

1.  Current age at least 18.
2.  Onset before age 15 as indicated by a history of three or more of the
    following before that age:
    1.  truancy
    2.  expulsion or suspension from school for misbehavior
    3.  delinquency
    4.  running away from home at least twice
    5.  persistent lying
    6.  repeated sexual intercourse in a casual relationship
    7.  repeated drunkenness or substance abuse
    8.  thefts
    9.  vandalism
    10. school grades below expectations
    11. chronic violation of rules at home/school
    12. initiation of fights
3.  At least four of the following manifestations of the disorder since age 18
    [each criterion is given further criteria for determination in the original
    text]:
    1.  inability to sustain consistent work behavior
    2.  lack of ability to function as a responsible parent
    3.  failure to respect social norms with respect to lawful behavior
    4.  inability to maintain enduring attachment to a sexual partner
    5.  irritability and aggressiveness
    6.  failure to honor financial obligations
    7.  failure to plan ahead, or impulsivity
    8.  disregard for the truth
    9.  recklessness
4.  A pattern of continuous antisocial behavior in which the rights of others
    are violated, with no intervening period of at least five years without
    antisocial behavior between age 15 and the present time (except when the
    individual was bedridden or confined in a hospital or penal institution).
5.  Antisocial behavior is not due to either Severe Mental Retardation,
    Schizophrenia or manic episodes.

Prior to the development of the _DSM-III_, Millon sought to create a questionnaire based on his framework for personality as described in his work _Modern Psychopathology_ stemming from a concern over independent attempts to do just that by various parties, resulting in the Millon Illinois Self-Report Inventory (MISRI) in 1972.[^134] As a personality inventory, the MISRI was not designed with the specific intent of diagnosing personality disorders, but of measuring personality in multiple dimensions (here called "scales"); however, an abnormal score on any given scale could be considered indicative of a disorder.[^134]

        Multiaxial Inventory," _Journal of Personality Assessment_ 97, 6 (2015),
        542.

This 150 item questionnaire was later, in 1977, expanded to cater to clinical uses by measuring psychiatric disorders rather than simply personality styles, becoming the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory (MCMI).[^134] As the MCMI (and its predecessor, MISRI) was self reported, a necessary addition came in the form of a validity scale, questions added to determine the seriousness with which the participant was answering questions presented.[^134] There were 20 clinical scales in the MCMI, 11 of which shared names with _DSM-III_ Axis II diagnoses and the other nine closely resembling Axis I diagnoses,[^135] these similarities being deliberate choices by Millon to tie to work done on the _DSM-III_ into his inventory.[^136][^137] The success of the MCMI as a measure of the _DSM-III_ was not all that significant when compared to existing methods such as the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI);[^138] though the MCMI did surpass the MMPI in popularity, perhaps due to the age of the latter and the former's catering to trending conceptions in psychiatry at the time.[^139]

Throughout the '70s, the classification of psychopathy continued to see usage in the psychiatric community despite its exclusion from the likes of the _DSM_ and the _ICD_; as other diagnoses were being given rigid and standardized definitions, a push began towards such a standard for psychopathy, among which a prominent member was [Robert D. Hare][139].[^97]

In 1975, Hare and Daisy Schalling organized an Advanced Study Institute (ASI) on psychopathy, funded by [NATO][82], that lasted 10 days in Les Arcs, France.[^140] The ASI would later be described by Hare as a "microcosm of the real academic and clinical world" with regards to the discussion of the construct, elaborating that said world contained "much armchair speculation and uninformed debate, but relatively little empirical research, about the nature of psychopathy."[^140]

[^140]: Robert D. Hare, "Psychopathy: A Clinical Construct Whose Time Has Come,"
        _Criminal Justice and Behavior_ 23, 1 (Mar. 1996), 26.

There was little consensus achieved at the initial ASI,[^140] but by the time of the 20<sup>th</sup> anniversary, when another ASI was held in 1995, a much clearer definition of "psychopathy" was carved out.[^141] The arduous journey of these two decades began with the publication of _Psychopathic Behaviour Approaches to Research_ by Hare and Schalling in 1978 based on the proceedings from the ASI;[^141] this was soon followed by Hare's own attempt at operationalizing the construct of psychopathy, particularly influenced by the conceptions of Cleckley,[^97] published in a 1980 paper titled "A Research Scale for the Assessment of Psychopathy in Criminal Populations."[^142]

        Criminal Populations," _Personality and Individual Differences_, 1, 2
        (1980): 111-119.

This research scale, which would come to be called the Psychopathy Checklist (PCL)[^143], was initially derived from the 16-item criteria list proposed by Cleckley with modification done by Hare through a study on 143 white male prison inmates.[^144] The result was a 22-item checklist that retained a high correlation to its source[^145] (to such an extent that factor analysis would show it to have the same number of factors);[^146] those 22 items being:[^146]

[David Shapiro][136], in his _Autonomy and Rigid Character_ (1981), reasserted the antisocial nature of sadism on the basis of the degradation of the victim being the goal and motivator of the perpetrator (in opposition to Fromm's descriptions of sadistic personalities).[^147]

[^147]: Millon et al., "Historical Conceptions...," 22.

**Siever et al. (1985)** sought to define a biogenic origin of antisocial personality, concluding that impulsive behaviors go against social bounds therefore indicating a lack of social learning which is described as a "lack of critical arousal" and "disinhibited motoric reaction to various stimuli" (essentially meaning a decrease in premeditation for any given action).[^148]

[^148]:  Millon et al., "Historical Conceptions...," 26.

**DSM-III-R**

As the _DSM-III_'s ASPD struggled to identify psychopathy among non-offenders due to its focus on criminality, attempts at refocusing the diagnosis towards a distinction of the ability (or lack thereof) to feel remorse were part of the revision process for the _Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Third Edition - Revised)_ or _DSM-III-R_.[^149]

[^149]: Cristina Crego and Thomas A. Widiger, "Psychopathy and the _DSM_,"
        _Journal of Personality_ 83, 6 (2014): 665-677.

The MCMI was revised in 1987, the revision then being called the MCMI-II, to adapt to changes between the _DSM-III_ and _DSM-III-R_ such as the addition of scales for aggressive/sadistic and self-defeating/masochistic personality prototypes[^139] and modifications to the scales for borderline and antisocial personalities and major depression.[^150] The revision also addressed research showing low correlation between MCMI scales and _DSM-III_ diagnoses,[^150] a correlation that became a higher focus for Millon with the MCMI-II.[^139] An effort to reduce noted overlaps between the scales in both the theory and criteria,[^150] though ultimately leading to the removal of some criteria meant to reflect the _DSM-III_ on the basis of a lack of ease with self-reporting, theoretical basis, or distinction between scales.[^151]

[^151]: McMahon, "The MCMI: An Introduction...," 11.

Weights were also added to the MCMI-II items, something new compared to the first MCMI, allowing more significant items for a given scale to count more towards the overall score than less significant ones.[^152] This was in addition to already existing features of the test to allow for greater analysis of the answers given, such as the base rate scores which were also updated with this revision based on studies using the newly updated inventory;[^152] more notably, the interpretation of the base rates was changes, with them no longer being intended to be used for directly determining a diagnosis using the determined threshold but rather to be used as indicators of the most prevalent features of the personality of the patient to whom the test was administered.[^153]

[^153]: McMahon, "The MCMI: An Introduction...," 13.

Antisocial personality in the MCMI-II, and in part in Millon's theory, was described by scale 6A (where scale 6B was dedicated to the new aggressive/sadistic scale)[^154] as an "actively independent" personality.[^155] Described in more detail as a focus on self fulfillment due to a distrust of others rather than narcissism, deriving security by countering an anticipated domination by others using manipulation and irresponsible and self serving behavior.[^155]

[^154]: McMahon, "The MCMI: An Introduction...," 16.

[^155]: McMahon, "The MCMI: An Introduction...," 15.

A contrast between the self perception and the perception of others is also described, with a person who has an antisocial personality viewing themselves as a rational realist but seen by others as argumentative and uncompassionate.[^155] This description, focused on the core personality rather than behavior, does not necessitate criminality, and like other past conceptions states that many affected persons may actually be affluent within a society that rewards 'realism' and uses competition as a means of social mobility.[^155]

By the late '80s, the previously discussed denotation of "sexual psychopath" would have lost what little favor it had retained since its denunciation by Karpman and Cleckley, as described by this comment in the 5<sup>th</sup> edition of Cleckley's _Mask of Sanity_ (1988):[^156]

> "_When the first edition of this book was written it had for many years been customary to use the term sexual psychopath to designate homosexuals, sadists, masochists, and also people specifically inclined towards exhibitionism, voyeurism, fetishism, cross-dressing, and pedophilia. Included at times with these deviations under the concept of sexual psychopathy were also types of abnormal behavior designated as erotomania and sexual immaturity. For many years before and after the initial publication of the_ Mask of Sanity _this custom had authoritative sanction in our nomenclature._"

The PCL was revised as the Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R) in 1985, but not formally published until 1991.[^157] The PCL-R contains 20 clinical rating scales (two having been removed from the initial PCL: "previous diagnosis as a psychopath or similar" and "drug or alcohol no direct cause of antisocial behavior")[^158], each measured on a 3-point scale (0-2) resulting in a total score ranging from 0 to 40.[^157] These scales are split into two factors: the first factor pertaining to interpersonal and affective traits such as egocentricity, manipulativeness, and callousness; the second factor then relating to antisocial and unstable lifestyle, impulsiveness, and social deviation.[^157]

Diagnoses of psychopathy by the standards of the PCL-R were much more exclusive than those of ASPD by the _DSM-III-R_, with the former applying to 15-25% of forensic populations and the latter to 50-75%.[^159] Those diagnosed with psychopathy typically also met the criteria for ASPD, whereas the reverse (those diagnosed with ASPD meeting the criteria for psychopathy) was significantly less likely.[^159]

Following in the tradition of basing conceptualization of psychopathy on biographies of various criminals (see Karpman), Michael Stone based his analysis (1993) on the "annals of crime," concluding that psychopathy is defined by rebelliousness, aggressivity, mendacity, entitlement, and social isolation.[^160] Murderers, specifically, according to him, showed hatred and impulsivity.[^160] Like many previous theorists, Stone claimed that psychopaths' symptoms were exacerbated by alcohol consumption and that they are not "amenable to therapeutic efforts;" despite this overall mundane rehashing, Stone retains a historical significance in being the first among the group depicted here to explicitly mentions "despotic bosses" who "make torture chambers of the workplace" as examples of psychopathy.[^160]

In their 1994 paper titled "Personality and Personality Disorders," [Thomas A. Widiger][161] and [Paul T. Costa, Jr.][162] aimed to conduct an objective study by means of statistical analysis rather than clinical surveys.[^148] This work used a five factor system for describing antisocial personality;[^148] aptly called the [Five Factor Model][164] (FFM).[^161]

In response to concerns that the PCL-R (which could take several hours to complete) was too long, a shorter version called the Psychopathy Checklist: Screening Version (PCL:SV) was developed from 1993 to 1995 with the support of the John D. and Catherin T. MacArthur Foundation.[^162][^163] This new test shared the same basic structure as the PCL-R with a reduction from 20 items to 12,[^162] retaining the essence of the PCL-R but removing the costly requirements of case history and interview information.[^164]

Being less thorough of a test, the PCL:SV is meant primarily as a _predictor_ of PCL-R scores, thus term "Screening Version," and has been shown to function well in this role[^165], with scores $\ge13$ and $\lt18$ being considered "possible psychopaths" with need for further review using the PCL-R and those $\ge18$ being considered psychopaths outright.[^166][^167]

Traditionally, psychiatrists would avoid diagnosing adolescents in terms of psychopathy, with some definitions even explicitly excluding the idea, in part due to the difficulty of distinguishing the early indicators of psychopathy from the symptoms of conduct disorder, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and oppositional defiant disorder.[^162] However, in 1994, [Paul J. Frick][159], Bridget S. O'Brien, Jane M. Wootton, and Keith McBurnett, utilized a modified version of the PCL-R, for the purposes of analyzing the relationship between psychopathy and conduct in children aged 6-13 years old,[^162] with some success using factor analysis to show that such a test was capable of measuring two dimensions in children similar to those of psychopathy in adults according to the PCL-R.[^168]

Diagnoses based on the PCL:YV in adolescents were related to diagnoses of conduct disorder in a similar manner to the previously mentioned PCL-R and ASPD relationship.[^169]

### I-4.4 Standardization 4: The _DSM-IV_
{:#i-44}

**DSM-IV (1994)**

In the process of the development of the _DSM-IV_, the APA conducted a multisite "Field Trial" for the ASPD criteria with the goal of creating a shorter list of symptoms for the definition.[^169] The result of this Trial was a 10 item list of criteria for what they referred to as Psychopathic Personality Disorder (PPD), drawing from the PCL:SV and the _ICD-10_ definition of Dissocial (or Dyssocial) Personality Disorder (DPD):[^169]

1.  Lacks remorse
2.  Lacks empathy
3.  Deceitful and manipulative
4.  Glib and superficial
5.  Inflated and arrogant self-appraisal
6.  Early behavior problems
7.  Adult antisocial problems
8.  Poor behavioral controls
9.  Impulsive
10. Irresponsible

The _DSM-IV_, however, maintained the social deviance model seen in the _DSM-III_,[^95] largely excluding the PPD criteria as they did not significantly increase correlation between diagnosis of ASPD and self-reported measures of empathy, anxiety, and Machiavellianism.[^169] Again, the ASPD criteria here require there to be some level of misconduct that isn't attributed to another underlying cause such as a schizophrenic or manic episode.[^170]

[^170]: Hildebrand, _Psychopathy..._, 12.

While ASPD was deliberately separated from psychopathy in its development, the _DSM-IV_ regardless stated that "[ASPD] has also been referred to as psychopathy, sociopathy, or dyssocial personality disorder," allowing clinicians to more freely use the ASPD criteria as a means by which to diagnose psychopathy.[^171]

[^171]: Hare, "Psychopathy," 34.

        and the _DSM&mdash;IV_ Criteria for Antisocial Personality

        391-398.

**MCMI-III (1994)**

Millon's research and theory continued to evolve through his career (up to contemporary times), eventually shifting to integrate evolutionary theory, linking the three basic accommodations of said theory: adaptation mode, survival aim, and replication strategies, with three polarities of personality: active-passive, pain-pleasure, and self-other respectively.[^173] Development of the third edition of the MCMI, the MCMI-III, would then be marked by attempts to implement this approach to personology into the test. This change in direction lead the MCMI-III to be criticized for diverging more than it converged with other conceptions of personality at the time, revoking the MCMI's key advantage of being in line with the diagnostics of the _DSM_.[^173]

[^173]: Choca and Grossman, "Evolution of the MCMI," 544.

Despite its success as a clinical instrument, there was a distinct downward trend in the amount of usage the MCMI saw in research from around the time of the MCMI-III onward.[^174]

[^174]: Choca and Grossman, "Evolution of the MCMI," 545.

### I-5. Self-Report Assessments
{:#i-5}

Tests like the MCMI and the MMPI provide some manner of self-report assessment of psychopathy, with the latter's "psychopathic deviate" scale existing since the '40s.[^175] Self-report assessment has the advantage in larger scale studies without the same costly requirements of guided interviews, but the previously mentioned tests are not focused on the measure of psychopathy and therefore include many items that would be extraneous in studies focused on the construct. Therein lies the purpose of tests like the Psychopathic Personality Inventory (PPI) developed by Scott O. Lilienfeld and Brian P. Andrews in 1996.[^176]

[^175]: Kevin M. Williams, Delroy L. paulhus, and Robert D. Hare, "[Capturing
        the Four-Factor Structure of Psychopathy in College Students Via
        Self-Report][180]," _Journal of Personality Assessment_ 88, 2 (2007),
        205.

        in Noncriminal Population," _Journal of Personality Assessment_ 66, 3
        (1996): 488-524.

The PPI took the approach of traits over behaviors in its measurement, containing 187 items scored on a four-point Likert Scale (ranging from one as false to four as true).[^177] The resulting score yielded an overall psychopathy rating as well as eight lower order scales:[^177]

[^177]: Natalia L. Nikolava, "[The Psychopathic Personality Inventory-Revised:
        Evaluation of Its Psychometric Properties, Incremental Validity, and
        Moderating Effects of Gender in a Correctional Sample][185],"

        18.

1.  Social potency
2.  Fearlessness
3.  Stress imunity
4.  Machiavellian egocentrism
5.  Impulsive nonconformity
6.  Blame externalization
7.  Carefree nonplanfulness
8.  Coldheartedness

The first three of these scales loaded onto the first factor, "Fearless Dominance", during an initial analysis, and the other five onto the second factor, "Impulsive Antisociality", which was later called "Self-Centered Impulsivity".[^177] Other analyses have suggested a three-factor model where "coldheartedness" is a separate factor on its own.[^178]

[^178]: Craig S. Neumann, Melanie B. Malterer, and Joseph P. Newman, "[Factor
        Structure of the Psychopathic Personality Inventory (PPI): Findings from
        a Large Incarcerated Sample][182]," _Psychological Assessment_ 20, 2
        (Jun. 2008): 169-174.

Moderately high correlation has been found between PPI and PCL-R scores in samples of male offenders,[^179] as well as convergent validity with the relevant scales in the MCMI-III.[^180] However, some studies have shown the first factor to correlate with positive traits rather than neuroticism and more importantly with other measures of psychopathy.[^181]

While it is seemingly the most discussed, the PPI was not the first self-report assessment of psychopathy. Five years after the development of the PCL, in 1985, Hare created the Self-Report Psychopathy (SRP) scale,[^182] a 29-item assessment which was subsequently revised in 1989 as the 60-item SRP-II published by Hare along with colleagues Timothy J. Harpur and James F. Hemphill.[^183] Of the 60 items, 31 were meant to describe the two-factor structure of psychopathy, with nine assigned to the interpersonal/affective factor, 13 to the social deviance factor, and nine to both;[^184] however, the scale ultimately failed to reflect the two-factor structure of the PCL.[^182][^185] Furthering its dissimilarity with the PCL, the SRP-II scale has a commonality with the PPI in that its first factor when a two-factor model is applied is negatively related to personality disorder symptoms (where they would be expected to correlate with narcissistic personality according to the PCL's structure).[^186]

Also predating the PPI, though only by a year as it was published in 1995, is the Levenson Self-Report Psychopathy Scale (LSRP), created by [Michael R. Levenson][190], [Kent A. Kiehl][191], and Cory M. Fitzpatrick.[^187] The LSRP is, akin to the SRP, based on the PCL-R and its two-factor structure, though with the slight deviation in that the factors represent Karpman's distinction of primary and secondary psychopathy.[^188]

        4 (Dec. 2008), 451.

A noteworthy extension of the self-report assessments' intention of brevity can be found in that the SRP-II[^185] and the PPI were given abridged versions, with that of the latter being titled the Psychopathic Personality Inventory: Short Form (PPI:SF) and containing a mere 56 items scored on a four point Likert scale upon its publication in 1990.[^189] Predictably, the PPI:SF had weaker correlation with conceptually relevant criteria than did the PPI.[^190]

In a 2001 paper titled "Refining the Construct of Psychopathy: Towards a Hierarchical Model," David J. Cooke and Christine Michie challenged the then dominant two-factor model of the PCL-R,[^191] claiming said model was not sufficiently backed in its analysis.[^192] They asserted an alternative three-factor model[^193] which they derived from analysis over several studies including cross-validation with the PCL:SV,[^194] the Psychopathy Criterion Set (PCS),[^195] and the DSM-IV ASPD field trial.[^196]

[^191]: David J. Cooke and Christine Michie, "[Refining the Construct of

Their model firmly supported a view of psychopathy as a personality pathology rather than a descriptor of behavior, where criminality is a correlate of the syndrome rather than a requirement in its definition.[^197]

[^197]: Cooke and Michie, "Refining the Construct...," 185.

Regardless of the three-factor model proposed by Cooke and Michie, Hare expanded on the two-factor model's structure further with the second edition of the PCL-R in 2003, with four lower order facets[^198]: antisocial behavior, impulsive thrill-seeking, interpersonal manipulation, and cold affect;[^199] where the first two subdivide the first factor and the latter two the second.[^200]

With the addition of the four-facet model, development on a third edition of the SRP, the SRP-III, began to address the lack of the antisocial behavior facet and to increase the number of items loading into the other three facets.[^199][^201] The desired structure was achieved in the initial 40-item version (31 items on which were found on the SRP-II)[^201] created in 2003 by [Kevin M. Williams][197], [Craig Nathanson][198], and [Delroy L. Paulhus][196].[^199]

[^201]: Lester, "The SRP-II as a Rich Source...," 5.

A revised version of the PPI, called the Psychopathic Personality Inventory&mdash;Revised (PPI-R), was published by Lilienfeld et al. in 2005, aiming to lower the reading level of the test and to remove items that were deemed to have weak psychometric properties.[^190] The revision reduced the total number of items from 187 to 154, the score of which still resulted in a single psychopathy score with eight lower order scores of which "social potency" was replaced with "social influence" and "impulsive nonconformity" with "rebellious nonconformity."[^190] These scales are grouped into three factor scales similar to those of the PPI: Self-Centered Impulsivity, Fearless Dominance, and Coldheartedness.[^190]

The triarchic model of psychopathy was developed through a reinterpretation of historic psychopathy concepts to deviate from the hegemonic Hare PCL-R conceptualization, describing a concept of psychopathy that encompasses three phenotypic constructs: disinhibition, boldness, and meanness.[^202][^203] [Cristopher J. Patrick][204], the author of the initial Triarchic Psychopathy Measure (TriPM) in 2010, pointed out that Cleckley and his contemporaries focused on boldness over meanness and the _DSM_ on primarily disinhibition among these three constructs;[^203] in general, the boldness facet of the triarchic model has very inconsistent representation in inventories based on other models such as the PPI, SRP, and LSRP.[^204] The TriPM, which was referred to as "brief Triarchic scales" was split into three scales (as one would expect) with 20 items dedicated to disinhibition and 19 for each of the other two, with items sourced from the PPI for boldness and the Externalizing Spectrum Inventory (ESI) for disinhibition and meanness.[^205] Work has also been done to measure the triarchic model using a subset of the Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire (MPQ),[^206] drawing items from its social potency, stress reaction, and harm avoidance scales for boldness,[^207] aggression and social closeness for meanness,[^207] and control, alienation, and stress reaction for disinhibition.[^208]

Development of the SRP-III continued through the '00s into the 2010s with a 64-item (answered on a 5-point Likert-type scale resulting in a total score from 64 to 320)[^209] written in 2012 by [Craig S. Neumann][202], Paulhus, and Hare.[^210] This version was designed to again follow the 4-facet model of the PCL-R, but like previous self-report assessments correlated well with factor 2's subdivisions (facets 3 and 4) but did not correlate significantly with those of factor 1 (facets 1 and 2).[^211] This period of the SRP was also when it gained its 28-item abridged version, the Self Report Psychopathy Scale-Short Form (SRP-SF),[^210] as well as a 19-item version adapted to multiple languages for international study called SRP-III-a or SRP-E (Experimental).[^212] Despite the heavy reduction in length, the latter of these abridged versions maintained the four-factor structure of the SRP.[^212]

### I-6. Dimensional Models
{:#i-6}

In 2007, a survey was conducted with four hundred members of two international organizations for research on personality disorders: the Association for Research on Personality Disorders and the International Society for the Study of Personality Disorders;[^214] 80.2% of the participants expressed the opinion that personality disorders are better described as dimensions (or spectra) than as categories.[^215] The most supported model in the survey, with 69.5% agreement, was a mixed system of categories and dimensions.[^216]

This preference for dimensionality over categories was shown in the development of the _DSM-5_, even as the relevant portions of the community had moved away from ASPD back to psychopathy[^217] (noted in particular by a stagnation in literature pertaining to the former).[^218] For instance, among the proposals for updates to the _DSM_ published in February 2010 by the American Psychiatric Association for comments[^219] was a "reformulation of personality disorders."[^220] This reformulation included a reduced set of five personality disorder types along with five severity levels from 0 (no impairment) to 4 (extreme impairment).[^221]

The five types in this proposal, antisocial/psychopathic, avoidant, borderline, obsessive-compulsive, and schizotypal type,[^222] were reduced from the _DSM-IV_'s ten personality disorders based on high comorbidity between the previous set and were chosen specifically due to their high severity (impairment at work, social relationships, and leisure).[^223] Furthermore, the model included six high order trait domains with four to ten lower order facets for each,[^220] four of which are derived from the FFM (openness was not found to be strongly correlated with any personality disorders) with the other two (compulsivity and schizotypy) introduced for coverage of obsessive-compulsive and schizotypal personalities.[^224] In combination, the listed disorders and traits composed a "hybrid model," as test cases showed that the models increased the other's ability to predict medical outcomes this was determined as the best solution.[^223]

Psychopathy in this proposal (recommended to be dubbed "Antisocial/Psychopathic Type") used a prototype based on both disinhibition and meanness.[^223] The description of the disorder once again described a prototypical case of a power seeking individual who would manipulate and exploit others, acting aggressively and sadistically, often engaging in reckless behavior to satisfy a great need for pleasure.[^225] Criminality was also again used as an indicator with the line "[i]ndividuals with this disorder often engage in unlawful and criminal behavior and may abuse alcohol and drugs;"[^225] however, it was not included in the list of associated traits which were divided into two categories: antagonism (callousness, aggression, manipulativeness, hostility, deceitfulness, and narcissism) and disinhibition (irresponsibility, recklessness, and impulsivity).[^225]

        Association, archived Feb. 15, 2010.

In general, this proposed system retained some notion of prototype matching, though the listed traits could be used for the entirety of a diagnosis there were still narratives given which raised the concern of prototype matching being still used as the primary means of diagnosis, especially since it could be seen as overcomplicated to describe a patient using all 37 of the provided traits.[^226] For the sake of brevity not much more will be stated here to critique this initial proposal, those interested could further read Widiger's "[A Shaky Future for Personality Disorders][212]."[^227]

[^226]: Thomas A. Widiger, "[A Shaky Future for Personality Disorders][212],"
        _Personality Disorders: Theory, Research, and Treatment_ 2, 1 (2011),
        55.

[^227]: As with all these sources, I strongly recommend a _critical_ reading of
        this work. Widiger rightly was appalled by the re-introduction of prototype matching in the _DSM_, but also from the beginning on seems to hold a double standard for empirical evidence between that which has already found its way in and that which is being introduced. He also displays significant concern over "coverage," and while admitting that there is a generic personality disorder diagnosis for those that do not fall into any of the five primary categories but have high scores among a variety of the defined traits believes this is problematic in that it does not leave a clear indicator on the patient's medical record. This is, of course, a greater issue with the overreliance on medical labels in the field than it is with the definitions themselves.

**MCMI-IV (2015)**

In the 3rd edition of _Disorders of Personality_, Millon introduced a category for "turbulent" personality in an attempt to rectify what he considered an issue of a lack of attention given to positive aspects in personality pathologies.[^174] This addition had some precedent in Kraepelin's description of "mania," generally pointing towards a maladaptive personality brought about through some manner of being overly adaptive.[^174] Another change to Millon's theories came about in a fundamental shift towards dimensional views rather than categorical ones, treating the pathologies he described as "severities" and "spectra" rather than "disorders" or "styles."[^174]

        Diseases and Related Health Problems_ 11th Revision (Geneva: World

> "_The core feature of the Dissociality trait domain is disregard for the rights and feelings of others, encompassing both self-centeredness and lack of empathy. Common manifestations of Dissociality, not all of which may be present in a given individual at a given time, include: self-centeredness (e.g., sense of entitlement, expectation of others’ admiration, positive or negative attention-seeking behaviours, concern with one's own needs, desires and comfort and not those of others); and lack of empathy (i.e., indifference to whether one’s actions inconvenience hurt others, which may include being deceptive, manipulative, and exploitative of others, being mean and physically aggressive, callousness in response to others' suffering, and ruthlessness in obtaining one’s goals)._"

## II. _The Distinction of "Sociopathy"_
{:#ii}

The difference between "sociopath" and "psychopath" (with regards to their definitions) is similar to that between "pigeon" and "dove" or "crow" and "raven."

The trivial, etymological analysis of what "sociopathy" means would indicate that it simply refers to someone who has a disconnect with society; the _socio-_ prefix meaning "regarding society"[^229] and the _-path_ suffix meaning "disorder."[^230]

[^229]:   ["socio-,"][3] Wiktionary, accessed Sep. 27, 2018.

[^230]:   ["-path,"][4] Wiktionary, accessed Sep. 27, 2018.

Sociopathy is commonly used synonymously with Antisocial Personality Disorder (APD/ASPD)[^231] and due to the nature of personality disorders[^232] (and the history of the diagnoses, see section I-4) also more loosely associated with Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD). This tangential association's continuation in contemporary notions is largely due to conceptual overlaps between ASPD and NPD, both connotatively and clinically.[^233]

[^231]:   ["Sociopathy,"][1] Psychology Today, accessed Sep. 27, 2018.

[^232]:   Personality disorders are known to have high rates of comorbidity,
        meaning that a person with any given personality disorder has a higher
        chance of also having another personality disorder than a person without
        a personality disorder.

## III. _The Pseudo-Sciences and the Sciences_
{:#iii}

Earlier sections relied to various extents on the assumption that the reader is aware of what an assortment of outdated and pseudo-scientific fields entailed as well as the issues with said fields; this section then exists to clarify any confusion that would have resulted in the case of these assumptions being untrue, as well as establishing some needed background for understanding Section IV.

### III-4. Criminology

While it may be philosophically a valid position to view law as objective and thus assumed to necessarily exist, doing so would be at odds with the philosophical principles of science; based on that idea, any criminal diagnosis should be considered wholly separate from psychology as a science. However, that is not to say it is invalid to scientifically explore cases where such assertions on the nature of society are assumed true, rather that it is invalid to assume such cases are applicable to cases where one cannot reasonably assume said assertion is true. It is tempting to brush this off as the primitiveness of the past, a fallacy far too many fall into, to assume humans hadn't a clue what they were doing until just yesterday. In this case, we can look to [Peter Kropotkin][134] (_Пётр Алексеевич Кропоткин_),[^52] a man fairly prominent in various circles in his time, who in 1886 wrote:[^234]

[^234]:  Peter Kropotkin, "Law and Authority," 1886.

    Pamphlets_, ed. Roger N. Baldwin (Vanguard Press, 1927).

> "_Cleverly assorted scraps of spurious science are inculcated upon the children to prove necessity of law; obedience to the law is made a religion; moral goodness and the law of the masters are fused into one and the same divinity. The historical hero of the schoolroom is the man who obeys the law, and defends it against rebels._"

In the words of Murray Bookchin, "[t]he assumption that what currently exists must necessarily exist is the acid that corrodes all visionary thinking."[^235]

## IV. _The Validity_

The crux of the critiques presented here is of a social and philosophical variety, that the side effects of this "psychopathy project" far outweigh the intended consequences. However, to determine the extent to which this assertion holds we must describe said intentions.

### IV-4. Forensic?
{:#iv-4}

## V. _The Conclusion_
{:#v}

These terms, psychopathy and sociopathy, originate as _explanations of criminal behavior_ rather than psychological analysis of observed personality traits, and so they serve not to describe an individual as one who suffers from a mental illness but as one who either seems as if or evidently is prone to criminal acts. By allowing these two ideas, psychology and criminology, to exist simultaneously in a given term and to use said term widely and offhandedly only serves to demonize mental illness and to write off transgressions as psychologically inclined (rather than socially motivated) behavior.

Definitions of psychopathy could more aptly be described as "List of People I Can't Fucking Stand" by various European proto-fascists than a clinical diagnosis. See: <http://sci-hub.tw/10.1001/archpsyc.1972.01750220028005>[^105]

The past is soaked in blood, to simply reach into it and pull a chunk out for your own purposes will end in nothing but soaking your hands as well.
